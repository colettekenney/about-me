  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I am <strong>in love with learning</strong> new things. I am a <strong>mechanical engineer</strong>, with a <strong>masters in psychology</strong>, who is now learning to become a <strong>full-stack web developer</strong>. I'm excited about all the <a href="http://niceportfol.io/" target ="_blank">cool stuff</a> I'm going to one day create!</p>
  <p>I love <strong>efficiency</strong>, <strong>logic</strong>, and <strong>orgnization</strong>. I feel at ease when things are in order. But this is not to say that I don't appreciate the randomness of life. I do. And that is the reason for my love of creating abstract art. </p>
  <h2>Other Things I Love:</h2>
			      <ul>
        				<li>My husband Todd</li>
				        <li>Our old dog Rusty</li>
				        <li>My pals, Monica, Terri, Shannon, Kirstin, Carla, Melissa, Nicola, Valerie, Melanie... I'm lucky. I've got WAY too many to list them all!</li>
				        <li>Abstract acrylic painting</li>
				        <li>Mountain biking (even despite breaking my collar bone last year)</li>
				        <li>Downhill and cross-country skiing</li>
				        <li>Working from home</li>
				        <li>Chocolate</li>
				        <li>Sparkling Water</li>
				        <li>Salad</li>
			      </ul>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
			<p>I'm originally from a very small town in Manitoba called St. Adolphe. That's where I grew up. We moved to the city (Winnipeg) when I was 14 and that's where I went to university, to get my first degree in Mechanical Engineering</p>
			<p>When I graduated, I moved right away to Calgary, Alberta. And for 15 years I have called it home. In the past three years we've been spending more and more time at our recreation property in Golden, BC. And this is where I love to be! Living full-time in <strong>Golden is WHY</strong> I am becoming a full-stack web developer. So I can <strong>work from here</strong>, and still make really good money, while being around all the things I love (see list above!)</p>
